# Orkanskader

Harnessing data to forecast hurricane impact and financial losses.

### About
**_orkanskader_**, a term for "hurricane damage" in Norwegian, is a project intent on analyzing the radial impact of hurricanes based on historical data.

The project consists of a couple of segments,
1. estimating the radial impact of hurricanes based on historically observed data.
2. mapping the affected areas based on damage severity via proximity to the eye of storm.
3. estimating the overall and categorical financial losses incurred by owners of residential properties affected by the storm. 
4. if we're lucky, we may add another components to estimate loss to insurance companies!
